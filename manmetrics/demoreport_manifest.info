# possible values: 'overwrite', 'new_key'. For 'overwrite, the file will overwrite the
# old file, and will be visible at the same url as the old file. For 'new_key', a new 
# url will be generated and thus the old and new files will both be accessible.
duplicates: overwrite

# (optional) send notification email on overwrite?
# (When a new key is generated, an email is sent unconditionally)
